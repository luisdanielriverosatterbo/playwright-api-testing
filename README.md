# Mastering Playwright as a API test automation tool

### About

I took this advanced and comprehensive course to transition from other frameworks to Playwright, and to get back as a **Test Automation Engineer** into this incredible area of knowledge such as **Software Quality Assurance**.

Through this work, you will be able to validate my acquired knowledge and part of my experience in this technical specialty. You will also be able to download and install the dependencies following the instructions to review the work more thoroughly.

### Content learned in these test scripts


**1.-** Working on setting up a project and inspecting Fetch/XHR tab in browsers.

**2.-** API Endpoints response, format and attributes.

**3.-** Mocking API.

**4.-** Modify API response.

**5.-** Perform API request.

**6.-** Intercep browser API response.

**7.-** Sharing authentication state.

**8.-** API authentication.

**9.-** Debugging APIs.
